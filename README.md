# data-analytics
We will be building a basic data analytics project, whose main focus will be on the deployment side of the product. Covering topics like, version control, containerization, orchestration etc., Let's dig into it. ;)


**Python-based Data Analytics Application**
This repository contains a Python-based data analytics application and a complete CI/CD pipeline using Docker, Minikube, Jenkins, and other tools. The pipeline automates the building, testing, deploying, and monitoring processes.

Technologies Used
Version Control: GitHub
Containerization: Docker
Orchestration: Minikube (Kubernetes)
Operating System: Ubuntu
CI/CD Tool: Jenkins
Build Tool: Maven (optional)
Testing Tools: Pytest, Selenium (if using a web interface)
Configuration Management: Ansible or Chef
Monitoring: AWS CloudWatch

**Setup and Installation**

Step 1: Setup Version Control with GitHub
Initialize your Git repository to start version control for your project.
Add your remote GitHub repository to your local repository.
Commit and push your initial code to GitHub to ensure it is stored and tracked.

Step 2: Containerization with Docker
Create a Dockerfile to define the environment and dependencies for your application.
Build a Docker image from the Dockerfile, which packages your application into a portable container.
Run the Docker container to start your application within the isolated environment.

Step 3: Orchestration with Minikube
Start Minikube, which sets up a local Kubernetes cluster.
Create Kubernetes deployment and service configuration files to manage the deployment of your application.
Apply these configurations to deploy and expose your application on the Kubernetes cluster.

Step 4: Setup CI/CD with Jenkins
Install Jenkins on an Ubuntu server to automate various stages of the pipeline.
Configure Jenkins by installing necessary plugins and connecting it to your GitHub repository.
Create a Jenkins pipeline script to define the stages of your CI/CD process, including building the Docker image, running tests, and deploying to Minikube.

Step 5: Testing with Pytest and Selenium
Install Pytest to facilitate the testing of your Python code.
Create test scripts to verify the functionality of your application.
Run these tests to ensure your application behaves as expected.
If using a web interface, install Selenium to automate browser testing.
Create Selenium test scripts to perform end-to-end testing of your web application.

Step 6: Configuration Management with Ansible or Chef
Install Ansible to manage configuration and automate the setup of your infrastructure.
Create an Ansible playbook to define tasks such as installing dependencies and configuring services.
Run the Ansible playbook to ensure consistent setup across your servers.

Step 7: Monitoring with AWS CloudWatch
Install and configure the AWS CLI to interact with AWS services.
Set up a CloudWatch dashboard to monitor your application's performance and health.
Add widgets to the dashboard to visualize metrics and logs for better insights.
